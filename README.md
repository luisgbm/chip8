# chip8

CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator written entirely in JavaScript.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8),

>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
